## What is Semaphore?

Semaphore is a data-aware, high performing **micro-service orchestrator**.
Create advanced data flows and expose them through multiple protocols such as HTTP, GraphQL, and gRPC.
Semaphore is designed to adapt to your environment.
Use your existing schema definitions (OpenAPI3, Protobuffers) to interact with your existing services.

### Key features

* **🔗 Connect with anything** Use the right tool for the job.
  Semaphore supports various protocols out of the box with
  the ability to supporting additional protocols through
  modules. Endpoints could be created to expose a single
  flow through multiple protocols.

* **🚀 Blazing fast** Semaphore scales up to your needs. Branches
  are created to execute resources concurrently. Branches are
  based on dependencies between resources made through
  references or hard coded values. Creating high-performance
  flows is almost boringly easy.

* **✅ Transactional flows** Make sure that your data stays consistent.
  Rollback data when an unexpected response is returned from
  one of your services. References to returned values could be
  made allowing to ensure that your customers have the best experience
  possible.

* **⛩️ Conditional logic** Only call services when needed.
  Conditional expressions ensure that resources are only
  executed when needed. Conditions grow to your needs.
  Whether you want to keep things simple or need to achieve
  complex goals.

* **🌍 Adapts to your environment** Semaphore integrates
  with your existing system(s). Define flows through
  simple and strict typed definitions. Use your already
  existing schema definitions such as Protobuffers. Or
  extend Semaphore with custom modules and proprietary
  software. Integrate services through flow definitions
  and create a great experience for your customers and
  your teams.
